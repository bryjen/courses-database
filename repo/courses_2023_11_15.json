This course examines how inclusion encourages respect for differences and how the removal of obstacles allows for participation in community life. This course identifies ways leisure spaces and practices support inclusion across a range of differences. Each student is required to complete a 16-hour placement at an organization that supports individuals at risk of exclusion.",

The input impedance is found and transmission line circuits are solved. The Smith Chart is derived and used to design impedance matching. Maxwell\u2019s Equations are used to find the wave equation, which is solved to discover uniform plane waves. Boundary conditions are enforced to find Snell\u2019s Laws and the Fresnel reflection coefficients for a dielectric half space. The fields in rectangular waveguide are found as the solution to a boundary value problem, and the behaviour of waveguides is studied. Antenna are studied including directional radiation, antenna arrays, directivity and gain, effective area, and the Friis Transmission Equation.",

    "Description": "The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the \u201CJazz Age,\u201D the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).",

    "Description": "This course utilizes the students\u2019 background knowledge of anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, exercise physiology, and exercise programming to design pre-season, in-season, and post-season conditioning programs for elite athletes in a variety of sports. Most importantly, this course focuses on the importance of applying scientific principles of training in the design of exercise programs for elite athletes. The importance of skill-related (i.e. speed, agility, and power) and health-related components (i.e. cardio-respiratory endurance, and muscle strength) of physical fitness relative to performance is emphasized in this course. Some of the topics covered include ergogenic aids, regulation of skeletal muscle mass, periodization, aerobic endurance and resistance exercise training, and plyometrics.",

This course assumes elementary knowledge of the Irish language as a platform for students to access cultural forms (memoirs, poetry, short stories, sean-n\u00F3s songs, films) and media such as radio, newspapers, television, and podcasts. In particular, the course examines how language is intimately tied to place and landscape (dinnsheanchas: the Irish lore of place names) and how it both actively and subliminally remains a potent force in Irish cultural life.",

Students also develop skills to identify errors and misrepresentations in information presented in the media and in viewpoints driven by agendas rather than evidence.",

The study of personality concerns itself with the psychology of the individual, individual differences, and the role of individual-level factors in explaining behaviour. In contrast, social psychology focuses on how behaviour may be influenced by social and contextual factors. Topics may include the many ways of describing the self and others, persuasion, group processes, close relationships, aggression, and prosocial behaviour.",
